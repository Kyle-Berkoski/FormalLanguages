Correctness:

- The program has a runtime error:
$ java ManWolf < input.txt 
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 4
  at Driver.process(Driver.java:40)
  at ManWolf.main(ManWolf.java:13)

(same if I do: $ java ManWolf gncgwng)

Style:

- Correct indentation

- Poor block comments

- Both files are missing the header. Remember: Each file must have a block
  comment at the top which gives the name of the file, the student's name, the
  assignment, the date, the version, and a comment about what is contained in
  the file. For example:
/**
 * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
 * author: student name
 * course: CMPT 220
 * assignment: project 1
 * due date: August 30, 2003
 * version: 1.3
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
 * type.
 */


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program seems efficient as implemented.

- The driverDFA.java file is incorrecly named as: ManWolf.java

- The ManWolf.java file is incorrectly named as: Driver.java 


CSV files:

- CSV files contain State-transition table and description of states.

- Usually in state-transision tables, the rows are the states, and columns are
  the alphabet.
