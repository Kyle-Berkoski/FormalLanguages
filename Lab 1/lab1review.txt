Both essays respond and address the question correctly. Good job!

The DFA is lacking the following:
- error states or non-accepting states when you receive other symbol different
  from the one you expect to receive.

You could use $\Sigma$ more to save some space. Lets say that you want to make
an arrow if the next symbol is not an 'f', you could simply say $\{\Sigma - f\}$,
which means the set of all possible symbols of the whole alphabet minus 'f'.
